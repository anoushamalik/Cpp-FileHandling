This project is a cricket data analysis tool developed in C++. It allows users to search and analyze One Day International (ODI) cricket statistics based on various criteria such as player name, career span, runs scored, and country. The program reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and provides options to filter players by specific years, display top scorers, and aggregate statistics like hundreds, fifties, and zeros for players from a specific country. The tool is designed for cricket enthusiasts and analysts who want to explore historical data of ODI cricket players.
